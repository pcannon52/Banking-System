This is a basic banking simulation that utilizes java's object oriented programming

There are many features to add, but some I was thinking about were:
-A way to actually store and read the accounts created from a text file or maybe a json file. There should also be a way to store the bank objects created
-Implementing account type. E.g., Saving/checking accounts.
-Maybe an interest feature so that the simulation is more accurate. This would include simple/compund the user would have the coice to decide what type of account they have 
-A password login system instead. This would entail a password system.
-Bank admin account that would be the only account that has the ability to see all accounts and delete any accounts
-Implementing a GUI instead of a consol based menue.
-Adding transaction history.
